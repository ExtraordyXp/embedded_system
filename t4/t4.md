# Tutorial 4


1.  Write an assembly language program to toggle Port B 500 times with loops.

__Answer:__ [t4q1.asm](./t4q1.X/main.asm) 

2.  Assuming a crystal frequency of 4 MHz, find the time delay associated with the loop in the following code fragment with pre-scaling by a factor of 4.


	MOVLW	D’100’

	MOVWF	MYREG

	HERE		NOP

	NOP

	NOP

	NOP

	NOP

	DECFSC	MYREG, F

	GOTO		HERE

__Answer:__ [t4q2.asm](./t4q2.X/main.asm) 

3.	Discuss how you would implement a delay loop that is 10 times longer than that in Q3?

__Answer:__ [t4q3.asm](./t4q3.X/main.asm) 

4.    Write an assembly language program that counts from 0 to 9 and starts incrementing from 0 for 10 times with a delay of one second for each count.

__Answer:__ [t4q4.asm](./t4q4.X/main.asm) 

5.   Write an assembly language program to for toggling a specific pin say RB0 of Port B with a time delay of 1 second?

__Answer:__ [q5.asm](./t4q5/q5.asm)
